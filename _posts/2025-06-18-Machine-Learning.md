## What is Machine Learning
It is a branch of AI that focuses on creation of algorithms that enables a computer to independently learn from data and previous experiences. In other words, we can say it builds systems that can learn from and make decisions/predictions based on data.

## Types of ML
Supervised learning- it learns fromm labeled data
Unsupervised learning- it finds patterns in labeled data
Reinforcement learning- learns through trial and error rewarding system

## Importance of ML
Enables us to handle complex data
Enhances decision-making through data insights
Personalization and improved custome experience
Predictive analytics and forecasting
Fraud detection and cybersecurity
